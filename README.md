### ðŸ§± Dataset Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Site Area (square meters)** | The physical size of the property, often a key driver of energy requirements. |
| **Structure Type** | Categorical variable: `'Residential'`, `'Commercial'`, `'Mixed-use'`, or `'Industrial'`. These categories reflect different usage patterns and energy demands. |
| **Water Consumption (liters/day)** | Serves as an indirect indicator of energy useâ€”especially for water heating and pumping. |
| **Recycling Rate (%)** | May reflect sustainability practices and energy efficiency efforts. |
| **Utilisation Rate (%)** | Represents how intensively the site is used; higher utilization often leads to increased electricity consumption. |
| **Air Quality Index (AQI)** | Poor air quality may lead to more intensive HVAC usage, thus increasing energy demands. |
| **Issue Resolution Time (hours)** | A proxy for operational efficiency. Delays in resolving issues may indicate inefficiencies that lead to energy waste. |
| **Resident Count** | Especially relevant for residential and mixed-use sites; more occupants generally lead to higher electricity usage. |
| **Electricity Cost (USD/month)** | ðŸ’¡ The **target variable** â€” monthly electricity expenditure influenced by the above features. |
